Public Opinion Analysis

We will scrape various social media websites such as Twitter, Reddit, Google, and other forums using APIs in order to see public sentiment on a bunch of different matters, such as stocks, politics, etc. We will create a website to display the analysis. We could also add user interactivity where a user enters a word and it scrapes the web to find statistics about that word, and where one can enter a date in the past to fetch results for that date.
